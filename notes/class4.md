    - (Remember STAR & Signaling) - 10 min 44:36-33:36

    - Response:
        - My teammate and I were doing market research on an app that helped solved a problem in the health food industry. After doing research on other applications we had to create a digital prototype. My favorite app is the Google Search Engine because while using it I was able to easily look at other apps that are similar to ours and identify ways our app can be designed better. As a result of using the Google Search Engine I gained an understanding of how people who look for and interactive with apps similar to ours what they experience and what they expect and ended up incorporating that into our digital prototype
